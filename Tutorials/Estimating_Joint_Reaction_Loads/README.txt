Summary:

This example contains all materials and setup required to complete Static Optimization and Joint Reaction analyses on a walking gait trial.
The example uses a modified version of gait2392.osim, a 23 degree of freedom model containing two lower limbs, 
a pelvis, and torso as well as 92 muscle-tendon actuators.

TO run the example, use the Analyze tool to load and excute the static optimization setup file, followed by the joint reaction setup file.

You can run the setup files from either the gui or the command line.
