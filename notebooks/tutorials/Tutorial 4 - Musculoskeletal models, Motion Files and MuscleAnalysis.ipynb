In [OpenSim](https://opensim.stanford.edu/) [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.901024), a musculoskeletal model consists of rigid body segments connected by joints. Muscles span these joints and generate forces and motion. Once a musculoskeletal model is created, OpenSim enables users to create custom studies, including investigating the effects of musculoskeletal geometry, joint kinematics, and muscle-tendon properties on the forces and joint moments that the muscles can produce. With OpenSim, our goal is to provide a framework that allows the biomechanics community to create, share, and extend a library of models and dynamic simulation tools that can be used to study and quantify human and animal movement.

It is characterized by excessive flexion of the knee during stance phase, which is often accompanied by exaggerated flexion and internal rotation of the hip. One hypothesized cause of crouch gait is short hamstrings, and orthopedic surgeons will sometimes lengthen the hamstrings of such patients in an attempt to improve their posture and gait. However, other causes of excessive knee flexion are possible (e.g. weak ankle plantar flexors), and lengthening the hamstrings can compromise these muscles' force-generation capabilities [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2005.03.003).
