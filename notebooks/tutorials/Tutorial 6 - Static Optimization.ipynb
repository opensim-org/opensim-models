The technique is called  \"static\" since calculations are performed at each time frame, without integrating the equations of motion between time steps. Static Optimization can be very fast and efficient because there is no integration, but it does ignore activation dynamics and tendon compliance. See [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4029304) for more details regarding this and similar modeling and simulation choices and their pros and cons."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","**Purpose**\n","\n","In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform a Static Optimization analysis on a single stride gait trial and assess gastrocnemius activation and force production in a simplified example model ([gait10dof18musc](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Musculoskeletal+Models)).\n","\n","As with any analysis or simulation, the Static Optimization results' quality largely depends on the quality of the model, motion, and forces used as inputs. The model should have mass, anthropometry, and strength that represent the experimental participant; while the degrees of freedom and muscle geometry should be appropriate for the questions being asked (e.g., studying an upper body motion would require a more detailed upper extremity muscle set and skeletal geometry). The motion should contain smooth, realistic accelerations and all external forces during the motion (e.g., ground reaction forces) should be accurately measured and applied to the model. Additional forces (i.e., reserves and residuals) are often needed but should be small enough to not confound analysis. Any issues with your inputs will give you poor results or cause the tool to fail.\n","\n","In this tutorial, you will:\n","\n","*   Get an initial Static Optimization analysis running without error messages or crashes.\n","*   Improve the activation and force results by using improved motion data.\n","*   Learn how to reduce actuation from reserve and residual actuators.\n","*   Add passive forces and observe their effect on muscle activation.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_cj6YClyLG_C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Format**\n","\n","Each section of the tutorial guides you through certain tools within OpenSim and asks you to answer a few questions.

When trying to minimize the sum of activations squared, the optimizer can use small activation values to these force and torque actuators to generate large forces or torques. For example, with an optimal torque of $100 Nm$, an activation of $0.5$ will generate a torque of $50 Nm$. If, instead, the optimal force were $1 Nm$, the optimizer must now use very high activations to produce any meaningful torques. In this latter case (optimal torque = 1), an activation of $0.5$ would only generate $0.5 Nm$, and an activation of $50$ is necessary to generate $50 Nm$ of torque. Thus, when the optimal force is very low ($~1 N$ or $1 Nm$) the optimizer can still choose to use the reserve actuators when needed, but the cost is so high relative to the muscles that the optimizer will preferentially use muscles to generate joint torques over the reserve actuators."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Edit Actuators File**\n","\n","Edit the actuators file and change each actuator's optimal force from 100 to 1.
